# Fake-Website-Detection
The Fake Website Detection System assesses URL legitimacy using a blend of heuristics and machine learning. It generates lookalike URLs for comparison, checks each for domain age, SSL certification, VirusTotal history, and analyzes web content similarity to detect imitation. A Random Forest Classifier provides a final legitimacy score.
